# CPE-301-Final-Project-2024
This Final Project was designed by Mohammadali Afshar and Caleb Stickler. Mohammedali primarily designed the circuit, while Caleb primarily implemented the code. The stepper motor and fan motor do not work, but the other components work as assigned and the states all transition properly. The temperature threshold was set to 20 degrees Celsius, and the water threshold was set to 100.
